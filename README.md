# The-Royal-Game-of-Ur
A C# implementation of the Royal Game of Ur, the on of the oldest board game known.

The Royal Game of Ur was found in the 1920s from a royal tomb in the ancient city of Ur. The earliest boards date back to 2600 BC, but the game was popular until the Romans spread Backgammon. The board itself changed around 1000 BC, but this version is the original. The rules from Mesopotamia are unknown, but some versions have been reconstructed from a cuneform tablet describing betting rules. The tablet is from about 200 BC and was translated by Irving Finkle, who also extrapolated the non betting rules. You can see the game played here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I
